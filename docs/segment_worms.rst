Time Lapse Segmentation
=======================

Segment time lapse movies of elongating organoids using the ``segment_worms.py`` script:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./segment_worms.py path/to/timelapse.czi

Where ``path/to/timelapse.czi`` is the CZI containing the phase series to analyze.

This will run a multiple stages of segmentation, including estimating a per-well
background field, running background subtraction on each image in the time series,
then refining the contours through several stages and producing the final contours
and statistics as well as a number of plots that can be used to track the progress.

Once a time series has been segmented, the results can be analyzed with:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./analyze_segment_worms.py path/to/timelapse

Where ``path/to/timelapse`` is the completely processed directory generated by ``segment_worms.py``
